    # Registers objects in a single place. Based on Hashicorps's Vagrant Registry class
    #
    # This allows certain components (such as models, weather files, proxy settings, etc.) to be registered as blocks
    #   and lazily updated. This allows for the state of various objects to be updated through evaluation of or
    #   overwriting the key. An instance of this class is passed between jobs to allow for highly flexible workflow
    #   definitions. Note that hashes can be passed into the registry as follows: hash = {...};
    #   Registry.new.register(:hash) { hash } or Registry.new.register(:hash) { {...} }. This class will likely absorb
    #   un-abstracted elements of the adapter class, see Workflow#Adapter

    # @todo (rhorsey) registry should be a member of WorkflowRunner - DLM
    # @todo (rhorsey) how is this different than a regular hash?  why is it important to be able to register keys with blocks that return values instead of values, looks like the block is called on insert anyway? let's not go crazy on performance optimizations until we have to - DLM
